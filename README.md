# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have created this web page to store my notes for this coding Bootcamp. The web page is an effective way to store all the information in the one place and is nicely presented so it's easy to navigate. It will help me record learnings and retain knowledge as the course progresses. In building the site I learned the basic principles of HTML coding, how to design a site using CSS, giving a site functionality and usability with JS and how to effectively back up my work using Git.
